This allows keybindings that would normally be consumed by the shell to act instead the same as when the terminal is not focused, for example \`Ctrl+P\` to launch Quick Open.

&nbsp;

Many commands are skipped by default. To override a default and pass that command's keybinding to the shell instead, add the command prefixed with the \`-\` character. For example add \`-workbench.action.quickOpen\` to allow \`Ctrl+P\` to reach the shell.

Caveats:

- Restoring of the process current working directory depends on whether it is supported by the shell.
- Time to persist the session during shutdown is limited, so it may be aborted when using high-latency remote connections.`,"Revive the processes after the last window is closed on Windows/Linux or when the `workbench.action.quit` command is triggered (command palette, keybinding, menu).","Revive the processes after the last window is closed on Windows/Linux or when the `workbench.action.quit` command is triggered (command palette, keybinding, menu), or when the window is closed.","Never restore the terminal buffers or recreate the process.","Whether to hide the terminal view on startup, avoiding creating a terminal when there are no persistent sessions.","Never hide the terminal view on startup.","Only hide the terminal when there are no persistent sessions restored.","Always hide the terminal, even when there are persistent sessions restored.","Whether to hide the terminal view when the last terminal is closed.

Shell integration works by injecting the shell with a startup script. The script gives VS Code insight into what is happening within the terminal.

Supported shells:

- Linux/macOS: bash, fish, pwsh, zsh
 - Windows: pwsh, git bash

This setting applies only when terminals are created, so you will need to restart your terminals for it to take effect.

 Note that the script injection may not work if you have custom arguments defined in the terminal profile, have enabled {1}, have a [complex bash \`PROMPT_COMMAND\`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_complex-bash-promptcommand), or other unsupported setup.
