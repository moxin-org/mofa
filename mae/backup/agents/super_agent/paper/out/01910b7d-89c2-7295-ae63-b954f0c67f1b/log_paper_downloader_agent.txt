One of these challenges is that\nthe autonomous agent does not have an accurate model tailored to the specific\nhuman that the autonomous agent is interacting with, which could sometimes\nresult in inefficient human-robot interaction and suboptimal system dynamics.\nDeveloping an online method to enable the autonomous agent to learn information\nabout the human model is therefore an ongoing research goal.

Unlike\nany other technology, because of the decision-making ability of AI, ethics and\ngovernance became a key concern. There are many emerging AI risks for humanity,\nsuch as autonomous weapons, automation-spurred job loss, socio-economic\ninequality, bias caused by data and algorithms, privacy violations and\ndeepfakes. Social diversity, equity and inclusion are considered key success\nfactors of AI to mitigate risks, create values and drive social justice.\nSustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many\norganizations (government, corporate, not-for-profits, charities and NGOs) have\ndiversified strategies driving AI for business optimization and\nsocial-and-environmental justice. Partnerships and collaborations become\nimportant more than ever for equity and inclusion of diversified and\ndistributed people, data and capabilities. Therefore, in our journey towards an\nAI-enabled sustainable future, we need to address AI ethics and governance as a\npriority. These AI ethics and governance should be underpinned by human ethics.'}]

Final Answer:

### 1. Keywords: "AI Agent Architecture", "Multi-Agent Systems", "Autonomous Agents"

- **Title:** From Single Agent to Multi-Agent: Improving Traffic Signal Control  
  **Authors:** Maksim Tislenko, Dmitrii Kisilev  
  **Published:** 2024-06-19  
  **Summary:** Due to accelerating urbanization, the importance of solving the signal control problem increases. This paper analyzes various existing methods and suggests options for increasing the number of agents to reduce the average travel time. Experiments were carried out with 2 datasets. The results show that in some cases, the implementation of multiple agents can improve existing methods. For a fine-tuned large language model approach, there is a small enhancement on all metrics.

- **Title:** The Landscape of Emerging AI Agent Architectures for Reasoning, Planning, and Tool Calling: A Survey  
  **Authors:** Tula Masterman, Sandi Besen, Mason Sawtell, Alex Chao  
  **Published:** 2024-04-17  
  **Summary:** This survey paper examines the recent advancements in AI agent implementations, focusing on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities. The primary objectives of this work are to communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, share insights gained from observations, and suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design.
