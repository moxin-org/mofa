All requests are either done via POST or GET requests, and all responses are in the JSON format.\n## Protocol Calls\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#protocol-calls)\nThe primary endpoint of the HTTP Observatory is <https://http-observatory.security.mozilla.org/api/v1>.\n### Invoke assessment\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#invoke-assessment)\nUsed to invoke a new scan of a website. By default, the HTTP Observatory will return a cached site result if the site has been scanned anytime in the previous 24 hours. Regardless of the value of `rescan`, a site can not be scanned at a frequency greater than every three minutes. It will return a single [scan object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#scan) on success.\n**API Call:** `analyze` **API Method:** `POST`\nParameters:\n  * `host` hostname (required)\n\n\nPOST parameters:\n  * `hidden` setting to \"true\" will hide a scan from public results returned by `getRecentScans`\n  * `rescan` setting to \"true\" forces a rescan of a site\n\n\nExamples:\n  * `/api/v1/analyze?host=www.mozilla.org`\n  * `/api/v1/analyze?host=www.privatesite.net`\n    * `hidden=true&rescan=true` (POST data)\n\n\n### Retrieve assessment\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#retrieve-assessment)\nThis is used to retrieve the results of an existing, ongoing, or completed scan. Returns a [scan object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#scan) on success.\n**API Call:** `analyze` **API Method:** `GET`\nParameters:\n  * `host` hostname (required)\n\n\nExample:\n  * `/api/v1/analyze?host=www.mozilla.org`\n\n\n### Retrieve test results\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#retrieve-test-results)\nEach scan consists of a variety of subtests, including Content Security Policy, Subresource Integrity, etc. The results of all these tests can be retrieved once the scan's state has been placed in the `FINISHED` state. It will return a single [tests object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#tests).\n**API Call:** `getScanResults` **API Method:** `GET`\nParameters:\n  * `scan` scan_id number from the [scan object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#scan)\n\n\nExample:\n  * `/api/v1/getScanResults?scan=123456`\n\n\n### Retrieve recent scans\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#retrieve-recent-scans)\nRetrieve the ten most recent scans that fall within a given score range. Maps hostnames to scores, returning a [recent scans object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#recent-scans).\n**API Call:** `getRecentScans` **API Method:** `GET`\nParameters:\n  * `min` minimum score\n  * `max` maximum score\n\n\nExamples:\n  * `/api/v1/getRecentScans?max=20` (ten most recent \"F\" tests)\n  * `/api/v1/getRecentScans?min=90` (ten most recent \"A\" or better tests)\n\n\n### Retrieve host's scan history\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#retrieve-hosts-scan-history)\nThis returns all public scans made to a website. Including its grade, and score. Returning a [host history object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#host-history).\n**API Call:** `getHostHistory` **API Method:** `GET`\nParameters:\n  * `host` hostname (required)\n\n\nExamples:\n  * `/api/v1/getHostHistory?host=mozilla.org` (scan history for mozilla.org)\n\n\n### Retrieve overall grade distribution\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#retrieve-overall-grade-distribution)\nThis returns each possible grade in the HTTP Observatory, as well as how many scans have fallen into that grade. Returns a [grade distribution object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#grade-distribution) object.\n**API Call:** `getGradeDistribution` **API Method:** `GET`\nExample:\n  * `/api/v1/getGradeDistribution`\n\n\n### ~~Retrieve scanner states~~ `DEPRECATED`\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#retrieve-scanner-states-deprecated)\nThis returns the state of the scanner. It can be useful for determining how busy the HTTP Observatory is. Returns a [Scanner state object](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#scanner-state).\n**API Call:** `getScannerStates` **API Method:** `GET`\nExample:\n  * `/api/v1/getScannerStates`\n\n\n## Response Objects\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#response-objects)\n### Grade distribution\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#grade-distribution)\nExample:\n```\n{\n \"A+\": 3,\n \"A\": 6,\n \"A-\": 2,\n \"B+\": 8,\n \"B\": 76,\n \"B-\": 79,\n \"C+\": 80,\n \"C\": 88,\n \"C-\": 86,\n \"D+\": 60,\n \"D\": 110,\n \"D-\": 215,\n \"F\": 46770\n}\n```\n\n### Recent scans\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#recent-scans)\nExample:\n```\n{\n \"site1.mozilla.org\": \"A\",\n \"site2.mozilla.org\": \"B-\",\n \"site3.mozilla.org\": \"C+\",\n \"site4.mozilla.org\": \"F\",\n \"site5.mozilla.org\": \"F\",\n \"site6.mozilla.org\": \"B\",\n \"site7.mozilla.org\": \"F\",\n \"site8.mozilla.org\": \"B+\",\n \"site9.mozilla.org\": \"A+\",\n \"site0.mozilla.org\": \"A-\"\n}\n```\n\n### Host history\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#host-history)\nExample:\n```\n [\n  {\n   \"end_time\": \"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 23:24:28 GMT\",\n   \"end_time_unix_timestamp\": 1474586668,\n   \"grade\": \"C\",\n   \"scan_id\": 1711106,\n   \"score\": 50\n  },\n  {\n   \"end_time\": \"Thu, 09 Feb 2017 01:30:47 GMT\",\n   \"end_time_unix_timestamp\": 1486603847,\n   \"grade\": \"B+\",\n   \"scan_id\": 3292839,\n   \"score\": 80\n  },\n  {\n   \"end_time\": \"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 02:30:08 GMT\",\n   \"end_time_unix_timestamp\": 1486693808,\n   \"grade\": \"A\",\n   \"scan_id\": 3302879,\n   \"score\": 90\n  }\n ]\n```\n\n### Scan\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#scan)\n  * `end_time` timestamp for when the scan completed\n  * `grade` final grade assessed upon a completed scan\n  * `hidden` whether the scan results are unlisted on the recent results page\n  * `response_headers` the entirety of the HTTP response headers\n  * `scan_id` unique ID number assigned to the scan\n  * `score` final score assessed upon a completed (`FINISHED`) scan\n  * `likelihood_indicator` Mozilla risk likelihod indicator that is the equivalent of the grade [<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Standard_Levels>] (<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Standard_Levels>)\n  * `start_time` timestamp for when the scan was first requested\n  * `state` the current state of the scan\n  * `tests_failed` the number of subtests that were assigned a fail result\n  * `tests_passed` the number of subtests that were assigned a passing result\n  * `tests_quantity` the total number of tests available and assessed at the time of the scan\n\n\nThe scan can exist in one of six states:\n  * `ABORTED` aborted for internal technical reasons\n  * `FAILED` failed to complete, typically due to the site being unavailable or timing out\n  * `FINISHED` completed successfully\n  * `PENDING` issued by the API but not yet picked up by a scanner instance\n  * `STARTING` assigned to a scanning instance\n  * `RUNNING` currently in the process of scanning a website\n\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n \"end_time\": \"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 21:51:41 GMT\",\n \"grade\": \"A\",\n \"hidden\": false,\n \"response_headers\": { ... },\n \"scan_id\": 1,\n \"score\": 90,\n \"likelihood_indicator\": \"LOW\",\n \"start_time\": \"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 21:51:40 GMT\",\n \"state\": \"FINISHED\",\n \"tests_failed\": 2,\n \"tests_passed\": 9,\n \"tests_quantity\": 11\n}\n```\n\n### Scanner state\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#scanner-state)\nExample:\n```\n{\n \"ABORTED\": 10,\n \"FAILED\": 281,\n \"FINISHED\": 46240,\n \"PENDING\": 122,\n \"STARTING\": 96,\n \"RUNNING\": 128,\n}\n```\n\n### Tests\n[](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#tests)\nThe tests object contains one test object for each test conducted by the HTTP Observatory. Each test object is contains the following values:\n  * `expectation` the expectation for a test result going in\n  * `name` the name of the test; this should be the same as the parent object's name\n  * `output` artifacts related to the test; these can vary widely between tests and are not guaranteed to be stable over time. \n    * `data` generally as close to the raw output of the test as is possible. For example, in the strict-transport-security test, `output -> data` contains the raw `Strict-Transport-Security` header\n    * `????` other values under `output` have keys that vary; for example, the `strict-transport-security` test has a `includeSubDomains` key that is either set to `True` or `False`. Similarly, the `redirection` test contains a `route` key that contains an array of the URLs that were redirected to. See example below for more available keys.\n  * `pass` whether the test passed or failed; a test that meets or exceeds the expectation will be marked as passed\n  * `result` result of the test\n  * `score_description` short description describing what `result` means\n  * `score_modifier` how much the result of the test affected the final score; should range between +5 and -50\n\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n \"content-security-policy\": {\n  \"expectation\": \"csp-implemented-with-no-unsafe\",\n  \"name\": \"content-security-policy\",\n  \"output\": {\n   \"data\": {\n

We will assist you accordingly.\n##  What is an App License? \nThis is a type of license which would allow our end-users to gain access to the allocated service, product or software. For each of the above, the term “App License” shall mean the license established upon acquisition of the applicable number of copies of such product and payment of the applicable license fees. Each App License shall be eligible to utilize the Address Metadata API Service for no more than one application/website at a time. We practice a non-sharing principle between App Licenses and users are advised to sign up for a separate App License in the event of any extended usage for the requirement of more than one application or website.\n##  What are the Payment Options available? \nWe accept major credit cards that are supported by Stripe.\n##  What is your refund policy? \nPayments made are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any services already paid for.\n##  When will Account Activation occur? \nAPI Pro accounts will be activated within 24 hours after username and email has been received. _*Please make sure not to close the browser after payment. The system will prompt a form for you to provide a registered username and email after payment is successful._\n##  How does Renewal work for API Pro accounts? \nStripe billing is auto-renewed by default. Unless you cancel your subscription plan before your billing date, you authorise us to automatically charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle to your account.\nThe billing portal will provide an auto-billing date where information such as a renewal subscription term that will begin automatically after the initial subscription term or another renewal term will be reflected in your account unless you cancel or terminate prior to the commencement of new term.\nKindly contact us should you wish to turn the auto-renewal option off.\n##  How do I subscribe to API Pro for explorers other than Etherscan? \nTo subscribe to API Pro for other explorers, you will be redirected to Etherscan API V2.\nThis updated API provides the same comprehensive data with added benefits, such as access to multiple chains through a single API key. Additionally, all multichain plans are conveniently managed under a single account, making the process more streamlined and efficient.\n##  What is Etherscan API V2? \nEtherscan API V2 is a unified endpoint to access EVM data across 50+ chains.

They help automate business processes associated with selling on the Marketplace. A seller can use these APIs to search orders, print shipping labels and invoices, and manage orders at different stages of the order life cycle.\nDeveloper Support\nFor any queries or clarifications on environments, authentication, and APIs, raise a ticket through the seller or partner portal under API GA node.\n## Seller Registration[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#seller-registration \"Permalink to this headline\")\nTo start working with seller APIs, first register as a seller with the Marketplace at <https://seller.flipkart.com>.\nNote\nThe username and password provided during the registration process on seller dashboard does not provide API access\n## API Application Setup[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#api-application-setup \"Permalink to this headline\")\nDeveloper Admin portal\n  * [Sandbox](https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/oauth-register/login)\n\n\nAs a registered seller you can log into the **Seller Dashboard > Manage Profile > Developer Access** to create self access applications and to manage 3rd party API application access.\nImportant\n  * Testing the application integration in the sandbox setup is prerequisite to implementing it in a live (production) setup. Both setups use the OAuth framework.\n  * All seller APIs must be HTTPS requests. HTTP requests are not supported.\n  * Do not hard-code the Access Token value in the Authorization header as the token expires after some time - usually, 60days. If an expired Access Token is used, API requests would fail with `401` HTTP status code. You must regenerate the access token in such a scenario and use the new one in subsequent requests. Refer [Generating Access Tokens](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#gen-access-token-label) for details.\n\n\n### Sandbox Environment[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#sandbox-environment \"Permalink to this headline\")\nAPI Test Environment\n  * To access and test the self-serve APIs in sandbox, [click here](https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/swagger/#/Self%20Serve).\n  * To access and test the Order Management pull APIs in sandbox, [click here](https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/swagger/).\n\n\nThe sandbox is a staging setup where you can design, program, and test applications in a controlled environment before implementing them in the production environment.

Any volition will lead to permanent ban on Flipkart.\nNote\nApplication ID (`appid`) mentioned above and `client_id` used in the below mentioned OAuth APIs refers to the same thing.\n### Generating Access Tokens[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#generating-access-tokens \"Permalink to this headline\")\nReading Reference\n  * [About OAuth](http://oauth.net/2/)\n  * [Authorization Grants](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-8)\n  * [Client Credentials Flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/)\n  * [Authorization Code Flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/authorization-code/)\n\n\nOnce your application is registered, you need to generate an access token to be able to call the APIs. Flipkart API Authorization framework supports two grant types to generate access tokens namely, the **Client Credentials** (for Self access application) and **Authorization Code** (for third party application) flows.\n> **Notes**\n> ```\nOnly an authorized user once approved by Flipkart has access to use tokens. Below are the following grant_type:\n  * authorization_code,\n  * client_credentials,\n  * implicit,\n  * password,\n  * refresh_token\n\n```\n\n#### Client Credentials Flow(for Self Access Application)[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#client-credentials-flow-for-self-access-application \"Permalink to this headline\")\nThis flow should be used if you are a registered seller on Flipkart Marketplace and want to integrate with the APIs for your **own** orders and listings management.\n**☰ SHOW | HIDE**\nTo generate access tokens using the client_credentials flow, below API should be used. You can write code in language of your choice to make a REST call or use `curl` to get the access tokens.\n```\nGET /oauth-service/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&scope=Seller_Api,Default\n\n```\n\nThis API is authenticated using [Basic Access Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) mechanism and so the required `Authorization` header is expected. `credentials` to be used in header is base64 encoding of your `appId` and `appSecret` separated by a colon (`:`).\n**e.g.** if your registered application appId is `my-appId-1` and appSecret is `my-app-secret-1`, the credential to be used for Basic authentication would be the base64 encoding of `my-appId-1:my-app-secret-1`\n**Examples**\n  * **Postman**\n![https://img1a.flixcart.com/fk-sp-static/images/postman-oauth-1.png](https://img1a.flixcart.com/fk-sp-static/images/postman-oauth-1.png)\nUsing Postman is one of the easiest way to generate an access token and manually test and get a hang of the APIs. This screenshot of Postman can be referred to for building the request. As can be seen here, the `appId` and `appSecret` can directly be used as the `Username` and `Password` after selecting `Basic Auth` as the Authorization Type. Postman will take care of doing the base64 encoding and setting appropriate headers.\n  * **Java**\nIf you are using Java, you can use the access token generation code which is bundled with the API client provided by us. Refer to [API Integration](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#integration-label) section below for more details.\nAlternatively, here is a sample Java code which you can embed in your application to generate access tokens.\n```\nimport java.util.Base64;\nimport kong.unirest.Unirest;\nimport kong.unirest.json.JSONException;\nimport kong.unirest.json.JSONObject;\npublic final class MyFkApp {\n  private static final String CLIENT_ID = \"__CLIENT_ID__\";     // Replace with your application id or client id\n  private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = \"__CLIENT_SECRET__\"; // Replace with your application secret or client secret\n  private MyFkApp() {\n  }\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    String base64EncodedString = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString((CLIENT_ID + \":\" + CLIENT_SECRET).getBytes());\n    JSONObject respoJsonObject = Unirest.get(\"https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/oauth-service/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&scope=Seller_Api\")\n        .header(\"Authorization\", \"Basic \" + base64EncodedString)\n        .asJson()\n        .getBody()\n        .getObject();\n    String accessToken = \"\";\n    String error = \"\";\n    try {\n      accessToken = respoJsonObject.getString(\"access_token\");\n      System.out.println(\"Access Token : \" + accessToken);\n    } catch (JSONException jse) {\n      error = respoJsonObject.getString(\"error_description\");\n      System.out.println(\"Error occurred !

You can find this value in **Seller APIs - Developer Admin** portal\n>   * `redirect-uri`: The URL to which Flipkart will redirect the browser after authorization has been granted by the seller. The Authorization Code will be available in the `code` URL parameter. This URL must be specified as a valid callback URL while creating application in **Seller APIs - Developer Admin** portal.\n>   * `state`: An opaque value (random text field) which your application should add to the initial request and that Flipkart also includes when redirecting back to the application. This value must be used by the application to prevent CSRF attacks. For more information, see [authorization request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/authorization/the-authorization-request/) .\n> \n\n> Seller must login to the **Flipkart Permission Registration** page that appears using his/her login credentials.\n> **Flipkart Permission Registration page**\n> ![https://img1a.flixcart.com/fk-sp-static/images/signin-page.png](https://img1a.flixcart.com/fk-sp-static/images/signin-page.png)\n> After successful login, seller would be presented with a **Request for Authorization** dialog.

Using the Authorization Code (code) from the previous step, you will need to send it to the Token URL.\n> **Token URL**\n> ```\nhttps://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/oauth-service/oauth/token?\nredirect_uri=<redirect-uri>&\ngrant_type=authorization_code&\nstate=<state>&\ncode=<code>\n\n```\n\n> **Sample Code**\n>> For sample code in Java, Python and C#, kindly refer to the _Examples_ in [Client Credentials Flow(for Self Access Application)](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#client-cred-label) . You just need to replace the URL in the code with the **Token URL**.\n> **curl**\n> ```\ncurl -u <appid>:<app-secret> https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/oauth-service/oauth/token?redirect_uri=<redirect-uri>&grant_type=authorization_code&state=<state>&code=<code>\n\n```\n\n> **Sample response**\n> ```\n{\n \"access_token\": \"f638949a­c979­4172­b33c­23311a168647\",\n \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n \"refresh_token\": \"860e03da­d58a­4988­9149-a4a7f365bba1\",\n \"expires_in\": 5183999,\n \"scope\": \"Seller_Api\"\n}\n\n```\n\n### Generating Access Tokens using Refresh Token[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#generating-access-tokens-using-refresh-token \"Permalink to this headline\")\n  * Sellers are also able to generate an access token by refresh token. Validity for access token is 60 days and for refresh token it is 180 days.\n  * The grant_type should be refresh_token and only Flipkart approved sellers can use the access token.\n  * When the validity of the refresh token expires, the sellers have to request to generate the access token again. After that, sellers get a new access token and a refresh token.\n> **☰ SHOW | HIDE**\n>     1. Call the authentication API. You can write code in any language to make a REST call or use `curl` to get the access tokens.\n> ```\noauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=<refresh_token>\n\n```\n\n>     2.

To integrate with the Flipkart Marketplace Seller APIs provided in this documentation, you could go through this API documentation and create your own application.\nHowever, the recommended way to integrate is to use auto-generated client code by using the [Swagger spec](https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/swagger/swagger.json). To ease the process, we are providing a sample java application which you can [refer](https://github.com/Flipkart/flipkart-seller-api-java-sdk) and start integration using the api client included in it. If you are using any other language, you can use `swagger-codegen` to auto generate the client code for that language. Steps to install `swagger-codegen` can be followed from the [official documentation page](https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-codegen/).\n### Code Generation[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#code-generation \"Permalink to this headline\")\n  * Python\n```\nswagger-codegen generate -i https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/swagger/swagger.json -l python -o flipkart-seller-api-client-python\n\n```\n\n  * C#\n```\nswagger-codegen generate -i https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/swagger/swagger.json -l csharp -o flipkart-seller-api-client-csharp\n\n```\n\n\n\n### Sample API Call[¶](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMSAPI.html#sample-api-call \"Permalink to this headline\")\nThis is a sample code in Java which can be used to fetch the details of a shipment. This code is also provided in the above linked sample Java application.\n```\npackage com.flipkart.api.seller;\nimport com.flipkart.api.seller.v3client.api.ShipmentV3Api;\nimport com.flipkart.api.seller.v3client.model.ShipmentResponse;\npublic class MyFlipkartOrdersApplication {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n  String accessToken = AccessTokenGenerator.getClientCredentialsAccessToken(); // You need to write custom code for token generation if you are using your own auto-generated client code.\n  ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();\n  apiClient.setAccessToken(accessToken);\n  ShipmentV3Api shipmentV3Api = new ShipmentV3Api(apiClient);\n  String shipmentId = \"__SHIPMENT_ID__\";\n  try {\n   ShipmentResponse shipmentResponse = shipmentV3Api\n     .getShipmentDetailsByInternalId(shipmentId, null, null);\n   System.out.println(\"Order Id for shipment is \" + shipmentResponse.getShipments().get(0).getOrderItems().get(0).getOrderId());\n  } catch (ApiException e) {\n   e.printStackTrace();\n  }\n }\n}\n\n```\n\nIf you are creating your own custom application, you can refer to below `curl` command. The following sample calls the Filter Shipments API in the sandbox environment on providing a valid `<token>` value. You can change the URL to `https://api.flipkart.net/sellers/orders/search` to call the API in production.\n```\ncurl -H\"Authorization:Bearer <token>\"-H\"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"filter\" :{}}' https://sandbox-api.flipkart.net/sellers/v3/shipments/filter\n\n```\n\n[Next ](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/errors.html \"Response Codes\") [ Previous](https://seller.flipkart.com/api-docs/FMPlatOverview.html \"Flipkart Marketplace Seller Platform\")\n© Copyright 2017, Flipkart. \nBuilt with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) using a [theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme) provided by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org). \n",

\nGmail API 是一种 RESTful API，可用于访问 Gmail 邮箱和发送邮件。对于大多数 Web 应用，如需获得对用户 Gmail 数据的授权访问权限，Gmail API 是最佳选择，适用于各种应用，例如：\n  * 只读邮件提取、索引编制和备份\n  * 自动或程序化消息发送\n  * 电子邮件账号迁移\n  * 电子邮件整理，包括邮件的过滤和排序\n  * 在整个组织中统一电子邮件签名\n\n**注意** ： 在开发完整的电子邮件客户端时，不应使用 Gmail API 替代 IMAP。请改为参阅 [IMAP、POP 和 SMTP](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/imap/imap-smtp?hl=zh-cn)。\n以下是 Gmail API 中常用的术语列表： \n\n_短信_\n    包含发件人、收件人、主题和正文的电子邮件。消息一经创建便无法更改。消息由[消息资源](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages?hl=zh-cn#Message)表示。 \n\n_线程_\n    一组相关消息，构成对话。在电子邮件客户端应用中，当一位或多位收件人用自己的邮件回复某封邮件时，系统会形成会话。 \n\n_标签_\n    \n用于整理消息和会话的机制。例如，您可以创建“税费”标签，并将其应用于与用户税费相关的所有邮件和会话。标签分为以下两种类型： \n\n_系统标签_\n    内部创建的标签，例如 `INBOX`、`TRASH` 或 `SPAM`。这些标签无法删除或修改。不过，某些系统标签（例如 `INBOX`）可以应用于邮件和会话，也可以从中移除。 \n\n_用户标签_\n    用户创建的标签。用户或应用可以删除或修改这些标签。用户标签由[标签资源](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.labels?hl=zh-cn)表示。 \n\n_草稿_\n    \n未发送的消息。草稿中包含的消息可以替换。发送草稿会自动删除草稿，并创建带有 `SENT` 系统标签的邮件。草稿由[草稿资源](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.drafts?hl=zh-cn)表示。\n## 后续步骤\n  * 如需了解如何使用 Google Workspace API 进行开发（包括处理身份验证和授权），请参阅[以 Google Workspace

Then we went and stuck an API on the front so you can access it all!\n#### How can I use it?\nAll the data is accessible through our HTTP web API. Consult our [documentation](https://swapi.dev/documentation) if you'd like to get started.\nHelper libraries for popular programming languages are also provided so you can consume swapi in your favourite programming language, in a style that suits you.\n#### What happened with old swapi.co?\nswapi.co is not supported and maintained anymore. But since so many projects and tutorials used it as their educational playground, this is an \"unofficial\" branch.\nThis project is open source and you can contribute [on GitHub](https://github.com/Juriy/swapi).\nCreated by Paul Hallett Maintained by Juriy Bura ©2025  [Follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/juriy)\n",
