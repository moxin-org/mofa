For this to work you need performance, and a smooth workflow enabled by the right tooling. After having everything I wanted with C except stable code I moved to JavaScript and web technologies. However, this never got to the point of being able to make fast applications that use modern CPU and GPU power. Now with Rust we have a new chance. I've been an entrepreneur my entire life building VJ software in the 00's, then web UI technology and web IDEs with Cloud9, and am now reimagining the developer workflow in Rust with Makepad. And lately how to leverage AI to write Rust and UI code.\r\n",

In 2016, he launched LinTO (https://www.linto.ai/), an entirely Open Source personal assistant, reflecting his vision for open and accessible technology for everyone. \r\n\r\nIn June 2023, he started the OpenLLM France (https://www.openllm-france.fr/)  community. This community brings together experts to share knowledge and work together on developing a French, sovereign, and truly Open Source LLM.
